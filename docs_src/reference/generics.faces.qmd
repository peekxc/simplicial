# generics.faces { #splex.generics.faces }

`generics.faces(s, p=None, data=False, **kwargs)`

Returns the faces of a simplicial object, optionally restricted by dimension.

If _s_ has an existing method _s.faces(p)_, then that method is called with additional keyword arguments _kwargs_. 

Otherwise, the behavior of this function depends on the type-class of _s_. Namely, 
- if _s_ is SimplexLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-combinations of _s_ is returned. 
- if _s_ is ComplexLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-faces of _s_ (in any order) is returned. 
- if _s_ is FiltrationLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-faces of _s_ in filtration order is returned.
- if _s_ is none of the above but is Sized and Iterable, all combinations of _s_ of length _p+1_ are chained and returned.
