## faces { #faces }

`faces(s: Union[SimplexConvertible, ComplexLike], p: int = None, kwargs)`

Returns the faces of a simplicial object, optionally restricted by dimension.

If _s_ has an existing method _s.faces(p)_, then that method is called with additional keyword args _kwargs_.

Otherwise, the behavior of this function depends on the type-class of _s_. Namely, 
- if _s_ is SimplexLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-combinations of _s_ is created. 
- if _s_ is ComplexLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-faces of _s_ is created. 
- if _s_ is FiltrationLike, then a generator enumerating _p_-faces of _s_ in filtration order is created.
