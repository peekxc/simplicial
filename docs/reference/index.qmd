# API Reference

## Explicit classes

Classes which represent simplicial complexes explicitly

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [MutableFiltration](/reference/MutableFiltration.qmd) | Simplicial Filtration  |
| [SimplicialComplex](/reference/SimplicialComplex.qmd) | Abstract Simplicial Complex |
| [SimplexTree](/reference/SimplexTree.qmd) | SimplexTree provides lightweight wrapper around a Simplex Tree data structure: an ordered, trie-like structure whose nodes are in bijection with the faces of the complex.  |

## Protocols

Structural subtypes for various types of simplicial complexes.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [SimplexLike](/reference/SimplexLike.qmd) | An object is SimplexLike if it is Immutable, Hashable, and SetLike |
| [ComplexLike](/reference/ComplexLike.qmd) | An object is ComplexLike if it is a iterable collection of SimplexLike objects and it has dim() and faces() methods. |
| [FiltrationLike](/reference/FiltrationLike.qmd) | An object is FiltrationLike if it is ComplexLike and is a Sequence of SimplexLike objects. |
