## SimplexTree { #SimplexTree }

`SimplexTree(self)`

SimplexTree provides lightweight wrapper around a Simplex Tree data structure: an ordered, trie-like structure whose nodes are in bijection with the faces of the complex. 
This class exposes a native extension module wrapping a simplex tree implemented with modern C++.

The Simplex Tree was originally introduced in the following paper:
