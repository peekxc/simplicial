# Overview: Simplicial Complexes

A _simplicial complex_ $S = (V, \Sigma)$ is a collection of simplices $s \in \Sigma$ satisfying: 

1. Each $v \in V$ is in $S$
2. If $\tau \subset \sigma$ and $\sigma \in S$, then $\tau \in S$

Though highly related, this package is structured for representing _abstract simplicial complexes_, the purely combinatorial analog to the topological space obtained by 'gluing' together simplices.
